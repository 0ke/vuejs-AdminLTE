            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
              Basetax was founded in 2012 by a chartered accountant who has worked in both private practice
              and large corporation in London.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2013 Basetax became one of the selective record keeping apps that appear on HMRC's list of
              software suppliers that have produced simple record keeping applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014 Basetax tax filing software was accepted to be recognised supplier that provides
              software for tax returns and supplementary pages by HMRC.
